the booty acquired in battle are indeed deprived of their property
in it, but its disposition is subject to the prince's pleasure, unless
the proportional shares to be retained by him and to be assigned
to the others concerned are fixed by law, as the Spanish ordi-
nances fix them for land war, leaving to the prince’s liberality
what he will allow to the others out of captures made in naval
war of which he bears the cost: ξ 9. Itis apparently because of
this difference that Ayala mentions those ordinances as assimi-
lating captured ships of war to land rather than to movables in
general: ἓ 3. Certain examples relating to booty and founded
on reason are cited with an evident intention of acting on them
in the performance of the author’s duties. Such are that those
who guard the baggage are to share equally with those who fight:
ἕ 6; that the troops are not to throw themselves on the booty till
the victory has been secured: ξ Ι 1 3 that those who have not done
their duty shall lose their shares: ξ 13 ; that fraud in the division
of the spoil may be punished by fines in addition to the loss of the
shares: ξ 123 and that the troops may be ordered to sell the spoil
which they are allowed to acquire lest the army should be ham-
pered and. seduced from duty by it: ἓ 14. It is also laid down
that things entrusted to the care of a sacred institution but not
belonging to it, res sacro commendatae, are not immune from
capture if enemy’s property: ξ 15.

In ἓ ξ 20 to 24, Ayala deals with various questions about the
recovery of personal conditions by postliminy, and then intro-
duces some observations of which the leading purport appears to
be the treatment of prisoners. In ξ 25 we learn that women and
children are subject to capture and enslavement but must not be
put to death, and that enemies found in our country at the out-
break of war may be made prisoners but can no longer be enslaved
as formerly they were. Also that canon law forbids touching
priests, monks, lay brothers, travellers‚ merchants and country
people, but that the prohibition has been repealed by desuetude,
except, in Ayala's opinion, for ecclesiastics so far as they do not
meddle with affairs of war. No legal relief can be given against
a bargain which a captive has made for his ransom, because the
fear of death or servitude which was its motive was not inspired
as a means of extortion‚ but was a lawful fear arising out of his
