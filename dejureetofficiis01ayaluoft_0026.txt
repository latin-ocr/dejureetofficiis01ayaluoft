BOOK I, CHAPTER 2.

We will now notice the most remarkable among the further
contents of the work here offered to the reader, in the order os
the text.

It will be well to premise that the three books into which it is
divided were evidently intended to bear titles corresponding to
the divisions implied in the general title—De Jure Belli, De
Officiis Bellicis, and De Disciplina Militari. In each book each
chapter except the first has a title of its own, While to the first
there is prefixed, in the case of the second and third books, the
special title of the book, De Officiis Bellicis or De Disciplina
Ilvlilz'tari. In the case of the first book the title which occupies
the corresponding position is not, as it should have been by
analogy‚ De Jure Belli, but that which logically belongs to it
as expressing the substance of the chapter—De Ratione Belli
Indicendi aliisque Caerimoniis Bellicis quae antiquo jure feciali
proditae suerunt. Theseis thus some confusion, which may have
been made either by Ayala in putting his papers together, or by
the printer, who may have been led to omit De Jure Belli as the
title of the first book because that form does not appear sepa-
rately in the general title of the work.

It must also be premised that the division of each chapter into
sections, quoted here as S, ξ, is made by figures in the margin
which are not placed accurately opposite breaks in the context,
or even opposite the ends of sentences. Their length is variable,
and their origin is difficult to account for.

In the second chapter of the first book we are told at the outset
that in general peace is preferable even to a just war with the
devastation which accompanies it, but that a righteous war is
better than a dishonourable peace. That a war may be called
just, it must be declared and waged by the authority and com-
mand of the sovereign prince. A private person can not wage
