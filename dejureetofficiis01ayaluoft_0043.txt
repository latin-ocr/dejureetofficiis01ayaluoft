which arms are an example, because they can not be lost by a
living man except through his fault, it is at once the captor's
booty. If it is such, the next question is whether the enemy has
secured at least a temporary possession of it, that is, in the com-
mon phrase, whether it has been brought intra praesidia. If this
has not happened before the thing is recovered, the property in
it has not been displaced, and the recoverer must restore it to its
owner, whether he recovered it by force of arms, by purchase, or
in any other way, except that if he recovered it by purchase the
owner must repay him its price. It, however, the thing has been
brought intra praesidia, its property has passed to the captor by
the laws of war, but on the recovery of the thing the property
will return to the former owner by postliminy. And if the re-
coverer was a fraudulent party to the capture, he will be liable to
the former owner not only for the restitution of the thing recov-
ered but also for what he might have saved from capture. In g 39
Ayala notes the Spanish ordinance which applied the question
whether booty had been brought intra praesidia to captures made
by pirates as well as to those made by an enemy, and can only
account tor it by supposing that “its object may have been to
stimulate the troops in the pursuit os: pirates and robberS, espe-
cially since it is legitimate to make provision for the public good
even at the costos private persons, as Tacitus says that every great
example has some injustice to individuals which is compensated
by the public utility.'' In ξ 40 Ayala expresses a rather hesitating
opinion that a thing first stolen, then captured by an enemy and
lastly recovered, need not be restored to its former owner, the law
os war which changes the property prevailing over the civil rule
that the vice of theft, which clings to the thing stolen, is not
purged until the thing has returned to the owner’s power3 but he
is clear that equity prohibits suit against the possessor in such a
case unless the value can not be recovered from the thies or his
heir.

The closing§ ξ of the chapter, 41 to 43, deal with the questions
whether incorporeal rights can be captured in war and trans-
ferred to the conqueror, and, if so, whether they are subject to
postliminy. On the first question Ayala decides in the affirm-
ative as to the incorporeal rights of a conquered community‚
