can they be lost by the longest term of prescription. The prince
is only a usufructuary‚ or at most holds his crown as a husband
holds his wife's dowry: ξ9. Bodin, seeing the insecurity of
any convention made by insurgents with their prince, advised
them not to be parties to such a convention, but to get some for-
eign prince to contract for them3 but Ayala advises them rather
to return to their duty and seek the clemency of their prince: ἓ 11.

It is an interesting problem how historical characters such as
Charles Ι. of England, and many of their supporters no less, who
were not on the whole bad men, can have been morally blind on
that side of conscience which relates to political compacts with
subjects. The arguments which have been quoted in some detail
are interesting as showing the question as they saw it. The base
of their position was the belief in a divine external order which,
where it is entertained, makes impossible secure political com-
promises affecting that order. The common humanity on which
the duty of keeping faith must be founded is not felt, by those who
identify themselves with a divine will to which they attribute
institutions, to exist between them and their opponents.

Except on the point which has been examined Ayala's standard
of faith was high. Faith must be kept towards a lawful enemy by
a private person as well as by the state or its representatives, and
Regulus did no more than his duty: ἕ 2. Engagements must be
interpreted without quibbling on their letter: ξ 4. Giving host-
ages does not permit a treaty to be broken, as if they were a substi-
tute for faith, the erroneous doctrine by which Bodin defended
the conduct of Francis Ι. If the French authorities whose con-
sent was necessary refused it to the treaty of Madrid, Francis
ought to have saved his personal faith by returning to captivity:
ξ 5. But even towards a lawful enemy faith is not to be kept if
that which was promised would offend God or be contrary to
good morals: ξ ξ 13, 14. All our actions ought to be referred to
the ground principles of justice3 first, that no one be injured;
secondly, that the common utility be served: ἓ 15. Breach of a
treaty by one party exempts the other, at his discretion, from the
duty of observing the same treaty, unless the broken clause is such
that it is not likely the contracting parties attached much im-
portance to it3 but it does' not authorise the breach of another
