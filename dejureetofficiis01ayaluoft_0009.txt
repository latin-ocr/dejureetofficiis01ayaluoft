PREFACE.

The Carnegie Institution of Washington has undertaken the
republication of the leading classics of International LaW and the
present volume, edited by the distinguished publicist Professor
John Westlake, is the second of a comprehensive series.

The grounds for including Ayala's treatise De Jure et Officiis
Bellicis et Disciplina Militari are sufficiently set forth by Pro-
fessor Westlake in his introduction. The original text is exceed-
ingly difficult to procure and has not hitherto been translated
into English. The photographic reproduction places the work
within the hands of scholars of any and all countries, and the
faithful and literary translation by Mr. John Pawley Bate makes
its mastery an easy matter to the English-speaking world.

One reason for republishing the classics of International Law
is the difficulty of procuring the texts in convenient form for
scientific study3 the libraries in the United States have been
searched with the result that few of the earlier works were to be
found. Another reason is that some of the works selected for
republication have never been translated into English. The
American publicist is therefore at a disadvantage in consulting
works of admitted authority, and when found they are, as it were,
sealed books to all but trained Latinists. The specialist is thus
forced to rely upon summary statements and references to them
to be found in treatises on International Law, or is driven to
examine them in European Libraries‚ often a difficult task, while
the general reader is practically barred from the stores of knowl-
edge locked up in the earlier works on the Law of Nations. The
same difficulty exists in Latin America, Japzm, and in a lesser
degree in many European countries.

Eminent publicists‚ European and American, who have been
consulted as to the usefulness of the plan to republish the ClassiCS‚
have indorsed the project and have pledged their personal co-
operation. The works to be included in the series have not only
