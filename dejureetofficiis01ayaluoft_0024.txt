scarcely have done more than put in order the notes which he
had collected before his appointment, and the three years which
remained of his life did not allow him to render any further
service to legal literature. He died, Nys tells us, “ at Alost, lst
September 1584, according to the authoritieS, but in August, if
we follow the text of his successor's commission, which is dated
the zoth of that month. He left a natural daughter, Barbe, who
married Henry Zoes, professor of law at Louvain, one of the good
Belgian jurists of the period, who died in 1627.'' *

The impression at once derived from reading the work of
Ayala is that it is not a treatise of which the system and the parts
have been logically thought out, and of which the conclusions are
supported by the authorities cited, but a mass of authorities and
examples collected from all ages and sources, arranged under the
heads supplied by their tenour, and accompanied by the author's
determinations on those heads. The learning is first and the
thought second. This however does not seem to be attributable
to any deficiency of the author, except in the sense that Ayala
certainly had not an original mind. His thought ran on the lines
which had been handed down for many ages, and demanded no
rearrangement of the traditional sign-posts by which its course
was marked out. It must be believed that his authorities had
been collected during the years which preceded his appointment
as judge-advocate—general, in view of a work to be carefully pre-
pared, and that when the press of official business interfered with
careful preparation he deemed it better to throw his materials
together into such form as he could speedily give them, than to
delay, and perhaps risk altogether, the publication of much that
was especially appropriate to the time. The want of final polish
in arrangement is thus easily accounted for and condoned, but
the nature of the author's mind stands out not the less clearly.

The question of Ayala's character is no less interesting than
that of his mind. Can we trace what it was in the times in which
he lived that most excited his grief or displeasure, and to which
