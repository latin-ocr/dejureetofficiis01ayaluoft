God or at least not certainly contrary to it, so that there is a
chance (fortasse) that the king may be guilty by reason of the
commands and the soldier innocent by reason of his servient posi-
tion. It is remarkable that Ayala does not go further into the
authorities, for they are interesting. In feudal times the duty of
allegiance to a lord had reinforced that drawn from simple civil
subjection. In the treatise entitled Feudorum Consuetzedines‚
which is commonly printed as an appendix to the Corpus Iuris,
we read (lib. 2, tit. 28) that according to some the vassal must
always aid his lord, without any distinction of case, but that
according to Obertus de Orto and Gerardus Campagistus, whose
opinion the author of the treatise adopts, this in an unreasonable
war is only true for the lord’s defence, and the vassal will not
lose his fief for refusing to aid the lord in an attack. Having
regard to the disputable reasonableness of most wars, and to the
possibility of representing an attack as a really defensive measure,
we can hardly doubt that the feudal liability‚ even as interpreted
by Obertus and Gerardus, would have a practical tendency in
favour of the claim of a pugnacious lord. We find therefore with-
out surprise that Thomas Aquinas does not so much as notice the
existence of a question, but says unreservedly that “ a private
person who uses the sword under the authority of the prince or
judge does not take the sword, but uses a sword placed in his
hands by another'': Summa Totius leeoloqz'a,· secunda parS,

But the received opinion of the sixteenth century did not go
quite so far, for Nys quotes Franciscus de Victoria as laying down
that subjects must not take arms in a manifestly unjust war, but
that if the notables of the nation, consulted by the king, pronounce
in favour of the justice of the war, the classes below them may in
good conscience conform themselves to their decisionfft Indeed
the increasing employment of hired soldiers, whose voluntary
engagement would deprive them of the excuse either of feudal
allegiance or of the duty of a simple subject, could scarcely fail
to inspire moralists with a hesitation which is perhaps reflected
by Ayala. Certainly, a little later, Suarez holds mercenaries to
