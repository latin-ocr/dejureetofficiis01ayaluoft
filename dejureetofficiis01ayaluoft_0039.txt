by Saint Ambrose on the Emperor Theodosius is cited: ξ 7; and
the biblical examples to the contrary are pronounced to be beyond
human imitation: ξ 4.

The right of reprisals on property exists because human law,
for the good of the commonwealth and the better repression of
offences, may punish by fine, confiscation, diminution of honour
and the like, even those who have committed no offence3 and so it
has often been enacted both in civil and in canon law, especially
for the sons and descendants of those who have sinned against
divine or human majesty: ξ 5. Hence a prince may authorise re-
prisals on property against a people who will neither redress the
injuries done by those whom they harbour‚ nor give up the guilty
to punishment. The practice rests on the same foundaffions,
divine, natural and civil, as war, and the authority of a sovereign
who has the right of declaring war is necessary for such reprisals:
ξ ξ 2, 1o. The authority of a judge is not sufficient, and they no
longer take place between fellow subjects‚ whatever may once
have been the case at Athens or elsewhere: ξ io. When reprisals
on property have been duly authorised, although the innocent can
not be personally attacked but only their goods taken, they may
be accidentally killed, because otherwise the reprisals could not
be executed. It is just as in war, neither the innocent nor women
and children can be killed of set purpose, yet they may be so by
accident, as when a city is besieged or bombarded, because war
could not otherwise be carried on: ξ o.

The fifth chapter of the first book is devoted by Ayala to cap-
ture in war and to postliminy. It is characteristic of the looseness
of his style that, although the principles on which he considers the
lawfulness of capture to depend are glanced at in ξ ξ 1 and 2, they
are fully explained only when he comes in ξ 16 to the enslavement
of prisoners. His view is that in the primitive age, the golden
age as the heathen called it, all men were born free and were
deemed to be peers and equals, and all things were enjoyed in
common. This state of things he refers to jus naturale, which he
says did not enact that men should be free, but slavery and prop—
erty were unknown, and its resulting silence about them left a
loophole for the later creation of those institutions. Evidently
then the ambiguous term jus in Ayala's jus naturale does not
