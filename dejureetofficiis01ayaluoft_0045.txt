Boox I, CHAPTERS 6-9.

The sixth chapter is devoted to the subject of keeping saith
with an enemy, and is a tolerably full and, with one important
exception, a good discussion of that subject, with the connected
one of the law and ethics as to keeping promises made in civil life,
whether with or without the sanction of an oath. The exception
is that Ayala repudiates any duty of keeping faith with those
whom he regards as rebels. He has pointed out that pirates and
robbers, as being the common enemies of mankind, can not claim
the performance of the engagements which they may have it in
their power to extort: ξό. This he extends to rebels, as also
not being lawful enemies: ἓ 7. And, “ as a consequence,’' con-
ventions which have been extorted by a usurping force (per
tyrannidem) are not binding. In their case there has been no
consent, which is required in all contracts, for consent is vitiated
by unlawful force. It is doubted by most whether a prince is ever
bound by a contract with his subjects, but certainly if they have
wrung the contract from him by insurrection, which is in itself a
breach of their faith to him, they can not claim saith from him.
Nor can it be expected that those who have violated both divine
and human law, by taking arms against their common parent who
has received his power from God, will themselves keep their
word.

Again, subjects can not give the law to their prince, therefore
any promise by him to them is a voluntary one, which can never
be binding. The common doctrine of the canonists, that the
pope‘s hands are never bound, is based on these principles. And
if a prince is injured by a contract he has the same right as one
under age to be relieved from it: ,ξ 8. The rights of the crown
are inseparable from the crown, and as the prince can not lose
his sovereign power by a voluntary abdication, or alienate any
part of his kingdom, so he can not alienate any of those rights. nor
