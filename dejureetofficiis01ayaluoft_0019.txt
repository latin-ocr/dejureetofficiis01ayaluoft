AYALA3 AND BOOK Ι, CHAPTER 1.

In a celebrated passage of the proleqomena or preface to his
great work, ἓ 37, Grotius mentions a number of books which he
had seen, some by theologians and some by doctors of law, treat-
ing specially on the jus belli, an expression not adequately trans-
latable in any short English form. Besides the laws of war, that
is, the rules according to which it ought to be carried on, it in-
cludes all that relates to the place of war in a philosophical system
of human life and conduct. And these predecessors he condemns,
all of them because they had said so little on a very wide subject,
most of them also because they had mixed up in disorderly con-

to the received law of nations (jus qentz'um). He goes on in ξ 38
to name three others who had attempted to supply what was most
lacking in the first mentioned, the light thrown by history3 but of
these he at once dismisses Faber as not having enunciated propo-
sitions to Which his citations might apply‚ while the other two,
Balthazar Ayala and Albericus Gentilis‚ had referred the ex-
amples cited by them to certain propositions laid down by them.
Grotius then admits his indebtedness to the industry of Gentilis‚
though he leaves readers to form their own judgment on the
doctrinal use to which Gentilis put his collections. Of Ayala he
only says—and, as we shall see, incorrectly—that he did not touch
the causes for which a war is called just or unjust. If these notices
do not amount to praise‚ at least they show that Grotius agreed
with general opinion in marking Ayala and Gentilis as his two
chief predecessors in what is now called international law. And
in any comparison of their merits Ayala claims our sympathy and
