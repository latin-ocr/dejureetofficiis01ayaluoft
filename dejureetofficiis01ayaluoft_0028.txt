authority of the prince, but the order ot‘ a judge having jurisdic-
tion will be sufficient: ἕ 14. This, however, is only true so far
as regards the measures taken for defence or for the enforcement
of jurisdiction. The further rights of war can only be exercised
against rebels when the authority of the prince has made the con-
test a true war, but even then the acts of the rebels, like those of
pirates and robbers, will not be covered by the laws of war, and
therefore they will not acquire the property of the things which
they capture and persons captured by them will not become
slaves: ἓ 15.

It will be seen at once that here we are concerned with the
question which in consequence of the Netherlands insurrection
must have bulked largest in Ayala's thoughts. Accordingly he is
not content till he has submitted it to a further examination.
Ulpian had said that the parties in civil dissensions were not ene-
mies to one another, so that the laws of war relating to capture
and to postliminy should be in force between them, and that
therefore enslavement was not the consequence of capture on
either side. And the “ ordinances of the kingdom of Spain,''
an authority which must have touched Ayala more nearly,
ordered the sevenfold restitution of things captured in the course
of civil dissensions. These rules, he explains, as is shown by
Ulpian's use of the word “ parties‚’‘ hold when citizens are at
variance only with citizens, but those who contend against the
majesty of the state and aim at its destruction are deemed to be
enemies.

So Cicero considered that the Sempronian law, which made a
vote of the people necessary for the capital punishment of a
Roman citizen, did not prohibit him from putting Cethegus and
Lentulus, the fellow conspirators of Catiline, to death. And so
also the Romans habitually visited their subject allies, when in-
surgent, with the extreme penalties of war: ξ 16. Indeed the
law of Solon, condemning to banishment Athenians who took
neither part on the occasion of a popular outbreak‚ had much to
recommend it, and in Ayala's own time the modest patience of
so many of the Netherlands people greatly aided the rebels: ξ 17.

But although the exercise of private judgment between con-
tending parties is admissible in a democracy or an aristocracy
