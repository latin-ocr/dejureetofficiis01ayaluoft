Books II AND ΙΙΙ.

The second and third books contain little or nothing that be-
longs to international law. Ayala's object in them seems to have
been to bring together all the maxims of policy or prudence which
he could find relating to war, whether app rehended, being waged,
or leaving questions behind it—-whether again such maxims were
generally accepted or were debated. This must not be understood
only of maxims belonging to philosophy, statecraft, or adminis-
trative science3 even strategy and tactics are not wholly outside
Ayala's purview, although he says comparatively little about
them, probably because in the then condition of military art
little of a general character had been said about them. The
merest technicalities of the military or naval profession are all
that he avoids. The authorities and examples are mostly taken
from classical or biblical antiquity‚ and next in frequency come
those of Spain, as where the extreme severity of the Spanish
ordinances for the case of the surrender of a castle is commented
on: book III, chapter 18, ξ §J 2, 5. Of course the difference of
circumstances and institutions would render a large part of what
Ayala has thus collected inapplicable to the Low Countries in the
sixteenth century, but we shall probably not be wrong in thinking
that he, as a special devotee of learning, was haunted by a notion,
due to the adoption of Roman law in the German or Holy Roman
empire, that more practical use might be made of his vastcollection
than it would now occur to any one to think possible. An instance
may be seen in book III, chapter 7, ,ξ 27, where he argues that the
privileges of Roman soldiers still belong to them, against what he
admits to be the general opinion, but claiming to have the most
learned on his side. A notable instance of an opinion ventured by
Ayala on his own authority, not supported by any citation of a
writer but only by examples, is that a man of some position (nobi-
lis) may act as a spy not only without discredit but even with glory,
when his motive is zeal for the public good ; though he admits that
to do so for pay would be discreditable to him: book III, c. 13, ξ 6.
