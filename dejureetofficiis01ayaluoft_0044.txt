because such rights are the creditor's property, and the property
of a conquered community passes to the conqueror together with
the persons forming the community. He can give laws to them,
and one who is in another's power can have nothing in his own
power. Therefore when Alexander had conquered Thebes he
was competent to receive from the Thessalians the hundred tal-
ents which they had borrowed from the Thebans, and if he had
done so, the Thebans u hen their city was restored by Cassander,
would have had no claim against the Thessalians.

On the second question Ay ala admits that there may be post-
liminy of an incorporeal right, and that, since Alexander had
merely assumed to remit the debt to the Thessalians, the restored
Thebans were entitled by postliminy to exact it from them, and
would have been so in whatever legal form the remission might
have been made. In that case there would have been law against
law, and the nature of the law of postliminy is to prevail over the
law of capture. If there had been payment to Alexander there
would have been law against fact, and “the law of postliminy
does not restore those things which have been removed by lawful
fact, for law has no supremacy over fact.'’ But the incorporeal
rights of a private person pass to his captor only when he is made
a slave, who can have nothing of his own, and now that between
Christians a prisoner does not become a slave his incorporeal
rights adhere inseparably to him.

The question is quite differently regarded by Grotius. There
is, says that jurist, no postliminy of a debt‚ and the absolute right
which Alexander acquired by the conquest of Thebes made his
remission of their debt to the Thessalians as effectual in law as
their payment of it to him would have been. Moreover there was
no restoration of the Thebans, for their city had been dissolved by
the conquest, and the Thebes which Cassander set up again was
a new entity. De Jure Belli ac Pacis,· l. 3, c. 9, ξ 9.
