when there are rival governments (scisso imperio), in a monarchy
every good and wise subject will rank himself on the side of the
prince who lawfully enjoys the supreme power: ξ 19. For as
soon as it has been determined that the commonwealth shall be
administered by one person, to whom by the lex reqia the people
have granted all rule and power over themselves, and who is
the common parent of all, there is the same duty to defend him
that there is to defend the country: ἕ 2o. Armed resistance to
him is parricidal and can never be justified: ξ 21. The prince
and the commonwealth are so connected that no one can be the
enemy of one without being the enemy of the other: ξ 22. Re-
bellion against the prince is comparable to heresy, and a person
disobedient to him is called infidelis, the double meaning of
which term—faithless and infidel—is justified by the question
of St. Jerome, “how can a man be faithful in the matter of God
(in substantia Dei) who could not keep his faith to his lord in
the flesh? ” To obey kings is ever the general pact of human
society, and while good kings are sent by God, bad ones must be
endured and their misdeeds referred to his judgment: ξ 23. It

follows that although a usurpet· (tyrannus) who has seized the
throne by illegal violence may be lawfully killed by any one if
the usurpation can not otherwise be ended, it is not lawful for a
private person to kill, or for the people to reject or to revolt
against, one who is the prince by right of succession or election,
however cruelly or unjustly he may act: ξ 24.

It must be noticed with reference to this passage that on 15th
June 1580 the prince of Parma had issued the edict which set a
price on the head of the prince of Orange, and that on 26th July
1581 the Dutch states-general had declared Philip to have for-
feited the sovereignty. Ayala must have written with these
recent facts expressly in view. He proceeds to declare that all
rule and power over the people are concentrated in the person of
the prince not only by the lex reqz'a but by the ordinance of God:
ξ 26. But the pope, to whom both the spiritual and the temporal
swords have been committed on earth, may depose kings, while
popular power is worse than that of any single tyrant: ξ 27.

From the amplifications on state government into which the
mention of war against rebels has led him Ayala returns to the
