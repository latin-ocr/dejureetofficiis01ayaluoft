our excuse for his shortcomingS, as being the first in time. He
died in 1584, the year before the publication of Gentilis's first
book, de Leqationibus libri tres. HOW early they both were in
relation to the development of thought on their subject will be
seen from the fact that it was not till 1612, after the deaths of
both, that Suarez, the greatest of Grotius's predecessors in the
philosophy of law, published his Tractatus de Leqibus et de Deo
Leyislatore.

Balthazar de Ayala was born a subject of the Emperor Charles
the Fifth‚ at Antwerp in 1548. His father, Don Diego de Ayala,
was a native of Burgos in Spain, and had obtained the rights
of citizenship at Antwerp in 1531—1532. His mother was the
daughter of Charles de Renialme‚ a licentiate in law and an
Alderman (belzevin) of the same city in 1531, 1532 and 1534.
Thus Balthazar had ties with each of the principal parts of the
vast dominions of Charles and his son Philip, but he was essen-
tially a Netherlander (Belqe). He had arrived at years of dis-
cretion when in the disturbances of 1566 the Netherlands began
to be convulsed by the struggle for civil and religious liberty,
and at years of manhood when in 1572 the insurrection was
placed on a firm footing through the seizure of the port of Brill
by the Sea-Beggars (queux de la mer). But neither Balthazar
nor any of his family appears at all to have doubted which side
they should take. His brother Gregory was a member of the
Council of Brabant. His brother Philip was Spanish ambassador
at the court of Henry the Fourth of France, and afterwards held
an important place in the financial administration of the Nether-
lands under the Archduke Albert. His first cousin, Gabriel de
Ayala, doctor of medicine of the University of Louvain, became
the public medical officer (mbde'cin pensionnaire) of the city of
Brussels, and published a volume of epigrams in Latin verse. A
relation, the Canon de Ayala, was a correspondent of Cardinal
Granvelle and was employed by the Netherland bishops as their
agent at Rome. Balthazar himself became a licentiate of law in
the University of Louvain, and we may conjecture that he spent

some time there in the acquisition of the learning of which his
book is full.
