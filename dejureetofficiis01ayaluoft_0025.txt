he most earnestly desired to bring some remedy? The answer
to this question may be learnt from the dedication and the preface,
which, though no doubt the last parts of the book to be written,
disclose for that reason the thoughts of which the abiding force
dwelt with the writer when the details of his subject had been
dismissed. Of Ayala's dedication to the Prince of Parma the
key-note is the necessity of maintaining ancient institutions‚ and of
his preface the key-note is the necessity of maintaining justice.
These, and not reason or humanity‚ were his dominant considera-
tions. His spirit was conservative and stern. Against innovation
he would make a stand. In accordance with this bent we find that
the first of the three books into which his work is divided begins
with the statement that, as the Romans were in all things careful
to study law, they followed that habit in declaring war no less
than in the things of peace, and that their constant success in war
was the· result of it. He then devotes the opening chapter to the
existence of the Roman fecials as a body to which the form of
commencing war was entrusted, the fixed law which they ob-
served with regard to that and to the other ceremonies relating to
war, and the Roman respect for such law.
