ERRORS IN THE MARGINAL REFERENCES.

These are not uncommon, and the second edition—which was pub-
lished at Antwerp in 1597, therefore after Ayala's death—gives very
little help in detecting them. The most usual error is in a number, say of
a Book of Livy or of a Causa in the Decretum: sometimes a passage is
assigned by mistake to the Digest instead of to the Code: sometimes a
small, but disconcerting slip is made in the name of a Title in the Digest
or the Code (thus de non foen. is given for de nautico ferm).

It is not proposed to give a list of such errors as have been found:
instead, the translator has corrected them in the margin of the transla-
tion. In the few cases where he rernains baffled (whether by an error
or by an obscurity) he has printed the reference as it stands in the orig-
inal (see, e. g., note a, p. 10οα, vol. 1, and note a, p. 219, vol. 1.).
