III.
BOOK I, CHAPTERS 3—5.

The third chapter of the first book is devoted to Single Combat.
The admission of that subject into a book on war is a scholastic
feature, belonging rather to the time when war, as a public
national contest, had not been so far differentiated from fighting
in general as even Ayala had differentiated it in what we have
already passed under review. He condemns single combat on
the usual grounds, except as between soldiers on the opposite sides
of a regular war, by the order or with the consent of the general
(ξ ξ 7, 8, 9), or when the princes on both sides agree to refer their
differences to the combat of two or more selected champions
(ξ g 10, 11), even in which case, however, Ayala deems it an
imprudent mode of seeking a decision, because, as Livy says, a
settlement which promises to be lasting is reached only when the
defeated party has contended with all his might (ξ ξ 12, 13).
Either the notion, if Ayala really entertained it, that these excep-
tional cases could occur in the days of Philip the Second and the
Dutch Republic, or the apparently serious mention of them with-
out such a notion being entertained, further shows the merely
scholastic character of the chapter.

In the fourth chapter Ayala discusses reprisals. He condemns
them so far as affecting the person of any but the guilty party,
basing himself on the Deuteronomic precept, “ the fathers shall
not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children
be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death
for his own sin ”1 ξ 3. And on the principle quoted from Ul-
pian in the Digest—lib. 9, t. 2, l. 13—that no one is lord over his
own limbs—dominus membrorum suorum nemo videtur: ξὸ.
From that principle Ayala concludes that not even under a law
or statute, to which every one is presumed to have consented, can
any but the guilty party be affected by corporal penalties, though
he may be so by pecuniary ones. Of course the penance imposed
