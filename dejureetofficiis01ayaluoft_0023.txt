By a further order, dated at Mons, 1st August 1580, there are
appointed for Ayala‚ by the month of thirty days, a hundred
florins for himself and sixteen each for a clerk, two serjeants and
an executiones, for the whole of which hundred and sixty-four
florins Ayala is to give a receipt together with an attestation of
his having had the said Officers in his service.

Three years later Ayala received an accession of power and
dignity. By an order dated at Tournai, zoth January 1583, the
Prince of Parma appointed him, on the death of Jehan aux
Truyes, a member of the great council and master of requests in
ordinary, his oath of office to be sworn before the president of that
council. But by another order, dated at Tournai, 4th April 1583,
reciting that the service of His Majesty‚ on which in his character
of auditor-general Ayala was then employed near the person of
the prince, did not permit his going to take the oath at Namur—to
which place the great council had been transferred from its usual
seat at Mechhn, in consequence of the occupation of the latter city
by the forces of the prince of Orange-—he is permitted to swear
it before the president of the privy council‚ and is confirmed in
the receipt of the salary of his new offices notwithstanding his not
being resident at Namur to perform the duties of a member of
the great council.

It would indeed seem that the auditor-general had his place so
fixed at the side of the captain-general that he required a special
command to absent himself, in order to perform elsewhere even
duties appertaining to that office. Thus we find an order of the
prince directing all officials to assist Ayala in the execution of a
command which he had received to accompany the Count of
Reulx to Louvain, Aerschot‚ Liege‚ Maestricht and other places,
in order to enquire into the disorders committed by the troops
there in garrison, particularly the outrages which they had done
to the commissioners of musters‚ and to correct and chastise those
whom he should find guilty. Thus Ayala’s public avocations
must not only have been engrossing, but also, as he followed the
headquarters of the army from place to place, must have kept
him at a distance from libraries. In the time which intervened
between his appointment and the dedication of his book, which is
dated from the camp before Tournai, 31st October 1581. he can
