just causes of war. It can not be waged against infidels merely
because they are such, for God, who makes his sun to rise on the
just and on the unjust‚ has not given the lordship over things to
the faithful alone but to all creatures endowed with reason: ξ 28.
Nor can the justice of war against infidels as such be deduced
from their refusal to obey the emperor, for although it is a com—
mon opinion that the emperor is the lord of all the world, yet the
most learned men, whose reaching is summed up by Covarruvias
and Ferdinand Vasquez‚ have proved the contrary: ἓ 29.

Here it will be noted that Ayala's Spanish origin and syrn-
pathies keep him on the side of the protest which Spain, France
and England, the homes of independent nationality‚ maintained
throughout the middle ages against the German and Italian doc-
trine of a world-emperor. The boundary of the authority which
the prelates of the Church, even the pope himself, have received,
is to be drawn between those who have never accepted Christian-
ity, with regard to whom St. Paul asked, “ what have I to do with
them that are without? ” and those who have once submitted to
the Christian saith but have fallen from it, against whom as here-
tics war can be justly made: ἓ 29. Against infidels‚ however, war
can be made for the same causes as against any one else, also when
they hinder the Christian saith by blasphemy or false argument
(pravis persuasionibus) 3 or when they hinder the preaching of
that saith, and so do an injustice to Christians, who have the right
of preaching the gospel throughout the world: ξ 30.

The causes of war which have been reviewed, Ayala next says,
are to be very carefully weighed by princes and kings, but if it
happens that these are led into war by greed the soldiers will not
be guilty, for they must obey their prince: ξ ξ 30, 31. But in
ξ 32 this is qualified by the reservation, “ unless it is clearly estab-
lished that the war is unjust.'' The question thus raised was an
old one. and our author cites in his support Saint Augustine, who
begins with a pronouncement in the sense of the wide one first
made by Ayala, and proceeds to base it on grounds which are
scarcely satisfactory. He points out that in peace the soldier is
the subject even of a sacrilegious king, and that in war the com-
mands given him are either certainly not contrary to the law of
