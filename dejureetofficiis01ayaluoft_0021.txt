The Netherlands military service was distinct from the Span-
ish, as might be expected from the fact that Charles the Fifth and
Philip the Second held the Netherlands—that is, the Burgundian
inheritance completed by the acquisitions made by Charles on
the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League—-in a merely personal
union with the crown of Spain. In 1553 Charles created for the
military forces of the Netherlands two great officers, the auditor
and the captain of justice. The character of the former office
may be learnt from the commission of its first holder, Doctor
Stratius, in which it is said that “ in order that we may be the
better able to keep our said army in good discipline and justice,
we have found it necessary to commission some scholarly person
(personnaz'ye de lettres), learned and experienced in the matter
of justice, to be with our captain-general of our said army, and
under him to execute the office of auditor of the camp and give
him good advice and counsel in what shall concern justice ’'. The
term captain-general was combined with that of lieutenant-gov-
ernor to form the title of the king’s representative in the Nether-
lands, as in Ayala's dedication of this book we find it applied to
the Prince of Parma in its Latin form of imperator. Thus the
auditor, as military judge and judicial adviser of the chief of the
army, held a position similar to that of the English judge-advo-
cate-general, and in one respect with more extensive attributes.
For while the rule in the Netherlands was that soldiers were
tried for common crimes, not depending on the quality of a
soldier, by the jurisdictions to which they were subject in their
civil capacity, an exception was made for foreign soldiers and
their servants who, if they did not fall under the special jurisdic-
tion existing for persons attached to the court, were tried for all
crimes by the military judge. Under this system the employment
of Spanish troops in the Netherlands must have made a consid-
erable addition to the duties of the auditor.·³‘÷

To this military auditorship Ayala was appointed at the age
of thirty-two, doubtless in consequence at once of family interest
and of the reputation earned by his studies. The following
