treaty: § ἕ 17, 20, 22. The rules 01 131111 316 1116 331116 101 truces
as 101 11631163 01 peace or alliance: ξ 18. But it is usual and
right, though not a matter 01 law, that a slight breach 01 3 truce
which will shortly expire should not be treated as ending it: ξ 19.
The perfidious character 01 311 enemy, though 011611 shown, does
not warrant a breach 01131111 towards him: ἓ 21.

The seventh chapter begins with a distinction 01 11631163 11110
three kinds—those which end a war by the complete surrender 01
1116 enemy, who thenceforward enjoys only such existence as the
conqueror allows him—those which end a war on 1611113, possibly
including the enemy's recognition 01 1116 conqueror's superiority
(ut is populus alterius populi majestatem conservet)-—and those
which are concluded in time 01 peace, possibly including a similar
recognition by one party. But no use is made 011116 classification.
A general's commission, even when conferring plenipotentiary
power on him, does not enable him to conclude a peace, unless
that power is expressly given: ξ 5. Truces 101 long terms, equiv-
alent to peace, 1311 under this rule, but not short truces: ἓ ὁ. It
will be remembered that in Ayala’s time the Ottoman empire con-
cluded peace with non-Moslem powers only 101 1611113 01 years.
In extreme necessity the prince may conclude a treaty not only
abandoning private property 01 1113 subjects which is in the
enemy's hands, but even taking other property from 1113 subjects
and giving it to the enemy, 101 1116 common utility is to be pre-
161161110 1113101 individuals: ξ 7. It would rather seem, though
it is not clear, that Ayala did not consider that subjects were
6111111611 10 compensation 110111 1116 0111166 01 1116 public treasury
for property so taken. When a prince dies who has concluded
treaties in the name 01 1116 commonwealth, they subsist both
against and in favour 01 1113 successor, whether taking as heir, by
a statute or by election3 unless where things annexed to the crown
have been alienated without the necessary consent 01 1116 060016
01 011116 6313163 (citra populi vel ordinum consensum, qui ad hoc
requiritur), or where the dignity and authority 01 1116 0111166
(majestas principis) have been impaired, which could not have
been validly done to the prejudice even 01 1116 deceased: ξ 10.
The last· reservation can not have been intended to apply to
treaties with foreign powerS, since Ayala, as we have seen, ad-
