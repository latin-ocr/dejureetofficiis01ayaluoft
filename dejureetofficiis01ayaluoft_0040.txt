mean law, but what might be called a right, in the sense of an
enjoyment which no one questioned. He goes on to say that in
later times, when, because of increasing wickedness‚ such a state
of things was found inconvenient, natural right reason, than
which nothing is more divine, dictated the institution of property,
and of war with capture and enslavement as the rights of war,
which thus by universal consent became the jus qentizmz. That
term, in which jus appears as law, Ayala uses in its classical sense
of the law in which the people of all nations are agreed and which
they apply in their respective communities—a fact, or supposed
fact, which carries with it as a consequence the application of
the same law to the mutual relations of those communities, in
other words its operation as what we call the law of nations.

The law of nations is thus accounted for as positive law, but to
what extent is it a righteous law? So far as concerns the laws of
war Ayala teaches that they are not wanting in an equity based on
the repression of injustice—-5 5 1, 16—and that they do not exist
in favour of brigands, pirates, or any one who is not a lawful
enemy: 5 18. If the remark had been made that even within
those limits the laws of war may operate in favour of the unjust
party, we do not know what Ayala's answer would have been, but
probably he would have said that the just must at least be armed
with the means of repression. although the decrees of Providence
may sometimes deny thern that effect. And one limitation of the
rights given by the general laws of war is furnished by the ancient
and laudable custom—for Ayala does not put it higher than this——
thatin a war between Christians those who are captured on either
side do not become slaves but are kept as freemen for ransom.
Even that limitation does not enure to the benefit of Christians
who fight for Saracens or infidels‚ or render them any kind of
aid, only although enslaved by capture they must not be sold to
any but Christians: 5 19.

The law that the property in captured things passes to the
captor applies only to movables, for captured immovables‚ such
as land, become the public property of the victor commonwealth:
5 3. And even with regard to the enemy’s movables‚ it is only
those that are acquired without a battle that belong to whosoever
has first gained possession of them: 5 8. The losing owners of
