it because he must resort to the courts of law for the defence of
his rights; but immediately, as if perceiving the inappropriate-
ness of that reason to a case where the opponent is not amenable
to a court of law, Ayala adds that a private person taking any
steps of the nature of war without the command of the prince is
guilty of laesa majestas by the lex Iulia, the ground of Which is
the lex reqia, by which the people has transferred to the prince all
sovereignty over itself and all power. If, however, the cause is
great and necessary, the prince absent, and delay dangerous, war
may be waged even without his order, especially for defence, the
right of which is allowed to every one by the law of nature, which
includes in that permission not only vengeance but even expelling
the enemy from his own land if with less we can not be safe from
him. In such cases there will be a just war and the laws of war
will have place, because effects follow their causes, and booty will
become the property of the captors.

But even the prince ought not to wage war without a just and
necessary cause, and ought not to be influenced by any lust for
doing harm, for cruel revenge, or for domination: ξ 10. The
principal objects of just war are the defence of one’s self and of
one's friends and allies, the recovery of what has been unjustly
taken away by violence, the vindication of injuries received, and,
if the injury has been done by private persons without public
authority, their surrender for punishment. The refusal of passage
through another's territory will justify war, for passage without
doing harm <transitus innoxius) is free by the law of human
society. That the passage meant is that of a military expedition
against an enemy is shown by the example cited, that of the war
of the Israelites against the Amorites who had refused them a
passage to the promised land: ξ 11. Nothing more clearly marks
the rudimentary conception of neutrality entertained in the time
of the renaissance than the assertion of this right, which indeed
was still axiomatic to Grotius. But the most just of all causes
of war is given by rebels or seceders (rebelles et imperio defi-
cientes), for they commit an injury against God‚ from whom all
power is derived: ‚8 ξ 12, 13. Yet since a rebel can not properly
be called an enemy, an armed contention with such is less prop-
erly called a war than an execution, and does not require the
