be strictly bound to enquire into the ‘justice of the cause for which
they fight.†

, At this point Ayala tells us that all he has sofar said about just
causes of war relates rather to right and equity, and to the duty of
a good man, than to the legal effects of war; and he makes a sud-
den transit to the other sense of justus, namely lawful by reason
of fulfilling certain legal requirements, as in the case of lawful
marriage, lawful age, and so forth. In that sense it is possible
for a war to be justum on both sides, and for a war declared
between persons capable of being enemies and not brigands to
entitle each side, however plainly unjust, to the rights of war,
such as postliminy and the enslavement of prisoners. This was
rightly maintained by Alciatus and Fulgosius‚ in opposition to
the received opinion based on the justice of the cause, which can
not exist on both sides: ξ ξ 33-35. Here then at last Ayala is
alive to the difference between the provinces of the legist and the
moralist in what concerns war. Had he recognised it earlier in
his work, he might have discussed more clearly the duty of a
soldier in an unjust war. But the time was not yet come, either
for him or for so much greater a man as was AquinaS, to think
adequately on a question involving the rights and duties of
conscience.

The short remainder of the second chapter is devoted to the
question of the expenses of war. The prince ought primarily to
bear them out of any revenues assigned to him by the people, but
if these are insufficient the whole kingdom must bear the burden,
and it can not be limited: ξ 37. The soldier ought to be paid:
ξ 38. And, serving for pay, he has no claim for his losses in the
war to be made good, as he would have were he not paid. But
if he has been summoned to fight in an unjust war, he will have
no right of action either for his pay or for his losses, because ex
causa turpi nulla datur actio: ξ 40. Surely Ayala did not mean
that a prince or a commonwealth might plead in court the injus-
tice of his or its own war, as an answer to an action arising out of
it? It would rather seem that the veil obscuring the confines of
morality and law, which had been raised for a moment, had
