iv

minute of his commission, preserved in the state archives of· the
kingdom of Belgium, is dated at Mons, 27th May 1580:

PHILIP etc. to all who shall see these presents sends greeting. Since
in order to guard, preserve and defend our countries on this side [the
Netlzerlands, as distinquished from Spain, Naples etc.] from the enter-
prises and invasions of the Prince of Orange and other heretics his
adherents, and to recov er the countries, towns and places which they
occupy unjustly and against all right, divine and human, we are now
preparing a camp, and an army of men of war both horse and foot,
under our very dear and well belov ed good nephew the Prince of
Parma and Piacenza, lieutenant-governor and captain-general of these
countries;

And since in order that we may be so much the better able to keep
that army in good discipline and justice, we have found it very requisite
and necessary to commission some scholarly person, learned and experi-
enced in the matter of justice, to execute in it the office of judge-advocate-
general of the camp [It will be noticed that this paraqraplz has become
common form] ;

We make it known that, considering this and desiring to provide for
the advancement of the said justice and the maintenance of good mili-
tary discipline, and fully confiding in the sense, scholarship (literature),
loyalty, diligence and experience of our well beloved Masoer Baltasar
d'Ayala, licentiate in the laws, we have, by the determination of our
said good nephew the Prince of Parma etc. retained, commissioned and
ordered, and do by these presents retain, commission and order him to
the said situation and office of judge-advocate-general of our said camp
and army, giving him full power and authority and special command-
· ment to execute and perform that office, to give advice and counsel to
our aforesaid good nephew the Prince of Parma and others whom it
may concern in matters concerning justice, as he shall find to be accord-
ing to right and reason and conformable to our proclamations and
ordinances issued and to be issued thereanent‚ and for the rest to do well
and duly all that a good and loyal judge-advocate-general of the said
camp can and ought to do, and that is competent and belongs to the
matter:

At such wages and emoluments as by our further letters patent shall

be taxed and ordered on that behalf.

The minute then goes on to direct Ayala to take the appropriate
oath, which is to include a denial of all bribery for obtaining the
said office, always excepting the accustomed fees of the Sieur de
Hauteville, state and privy councillor, who on receiving the said
oath is to induet Ayala into his office.
